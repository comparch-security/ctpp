CTPP: Conflict Testing with Probe+Prune
=============================================================

This is the source code for our RAID 2023 paper:

Zihan Xue, Jinchi Han, Wei Song. **CTPP: A fast and stealth algorithm for searching eviction sets on Intel processors**. In _the 26th International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses_ (RAID'23), October 16-18, 2023, Hong Kong, China. [[DOI]](https://doi.org/10.1145/3607199.3607202)

The development of CTPP is based on the [Prime+Scope](https://www.github.com/KULeuven-COSIC/PRIME-SCOPE/evsets) work.

# How to run

It basically runs the same way as the Prime+Scope demo:

~~~
cd primescope_demo
make
~~~
